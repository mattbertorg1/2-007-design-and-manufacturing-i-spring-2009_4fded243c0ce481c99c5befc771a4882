Your mission: Clean up planet earth and re-establish plant life.

![A photo of the 2009 competition table, with a row of skyscrapers dividing it into an area for each robot containing cans and bales of trash to be crushed and stacked in the appropriate target area.](/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-007-design-and-manufacturing-i-spring-2009/projects/chp_table.jpg)

The challenge for this year's 2.007 robots is to clean up the environment. (Image by Dan Frey.)

Robots begin inside their respective starting box (12" high, 22" wide, 10" deep) with the door closed. Once time starts, the door opens forming a ramp. You will have 60 seconds to exit the box, clean up the table, and/or retrieve the plant. For the first 10 seconds, your robot operates autonomously and in the subsequent 50 seconds under radio control.

The fate of the planet is in your hands!
